- "premade" (but also customizable) ui elements (buttons, text boxes, etc) with instanced rendering
- maybe force the window to be a specific resolution (for cudoku only? or all games?)
- border decorations for shapes (maybe. or maybe only for ui elements)
- remove the hardcoded 1920 and 1080 values when applying relative pixel constraints
and replace them with the screen's currently active resolution

text rendering improvements
  - [ ] unicode support (allows for non-ascii characters)
    - unicode support removed for the foreseeable future
  - [x] atlas texture for text glyphs (this means we only load in one texture for all text)
    - [x] better estimation of atlas width and height (currently the generated atlas texture
          has a lot of empty space (over 50% of the texture's height))
       - ended up just looping over the ascii glyphs and finding the max width and height

  - SDF generation allowing for better text scaling (slower but visually better)
    - SDF is too slow if we want to support unicode. it's acceptably fast for ascii only though.
    - An alternative is to use MSDF at a much lower pixel height (e.g 16) which results in
      better scaling than SDF (almost perfect) and is fast enough to include unicode.
    - Another alternative is using a pre-baked SDF texture atlas. This is the fastest
      but it's also the least flexible because we can't load arbitrary fonts
    - Maybe also rendering text as vector using bezier curves. Sounds like a lot of work though.

      Will probably end up using MSDF (if I can get it to work with C lol)

  - [x] instanced rendering for text (this means we only have to do one draw call for all text)
    running into problems. we got the positions to instance correctly but the texture coordinates
    are more difficult to work with because we can't just send a texcoord per vertex per instance
    - Ended up passing hardcoded texcoords of all glyphs to the shader using a uniform array which allows us to render infinite
      instances of text in one draw call without exceeding any buffer limits. Of course this does mean that if we were to support
      unicode we'd have to make the uniform array bigger and its size dynamic. So unicode is dropped for now
